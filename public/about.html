<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Almost all of Agatha Christie's novels are whodunits. They focus on English people of the middle and upper classes.</p>

<p>Usually the detective comes across a murder scene by chance or is called by a friend who may be involved. He or she questions the suspects, examines the crime scene carefully and gives the reader clues so that they may have a chance to solve the crime themselves. In the course of the story one, or even a few, of the suspects usually die.</p>

<p>Finally the detective gets all the suspects together and gives away information that not everyone knows, until the real murderer is revealed.</p>

<p>In some of Agatha Christie's stories the murderer escapes justice; sometimes they get killed. Twice the murderer turns out to be the narrator of the story.</p>
